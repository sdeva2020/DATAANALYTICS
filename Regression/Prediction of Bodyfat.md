Bodyfat plays an import role for a person being in a good health. 
The risk factor is high when the body fat increases or decreases. 
Here we have taken a dataset by surfing through the internet.
We have created a Data Dashboard for Bodyfat dataset, From the dataset we have done the data analysis by using Linear Regression. 
Linear Regression analysis is used to predict the value of the variable based on the value of another variable. 
The two variable is dependent and independent. From the bodyfat dataset, we have taken two variables for Dependent(BODYFAT) and Independent(AGE). 
Storage fat is found in Adipose Tissue is called BodyFat. 
Age is a number of years that a person have lived. For analysis and prediction we are using Jupyter Notebook. 
First step is to import libraries such as warnings,numpy,pandas and matplotlib. 
Next step is to read the file and know about the shape and information of the dataset and then need to take the dependent and independent column by dropping the unwanted columns in the dataset. 
Then we need to convert the data into array values and store in a seperate variables.
A Scatter Graph is denoted for those separate variables before the prediction. 
Next step is to import the sklearn library for Linear Regression, by using train_test_split function we need to assign system how much it should get trained and how much it should take for testing and random state should also be denoted. 
Next step is to create a dataframe for predicted data. Finally, need to save the file as csv.
Thus, by using Jupyter Notebook we have analysed and predicted the values.
